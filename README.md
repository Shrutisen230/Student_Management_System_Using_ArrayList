## Student Management project by adding Interface & Exceptional Handling
### Key Improvements: 
Interface (StudentOperations) defines all CRUD methods. 

Custom Exceptions: 

DuplicateStudentException → prevents adding same ID twice. 

StudentNotFoundException → handles missing student cases. 

Exception Handling in Main → program won’t crash, shows friendly messages.
